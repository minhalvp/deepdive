# DeepDive
A deep learning library built from scratch in Python.

## Installation
DeepDive only requires `numpy` as a dependency. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install deepdive-ml
```
## MNIST Example

DeepDive includes an example script that demonstrates how to use the library to build a neural network and train it on the MNIST dataset. 
To run the example run the `mnist.py` script:

```bash
python mnist.py
```
## Features to add
- GPU acceleration (WIP)
- 2D Convolutions
